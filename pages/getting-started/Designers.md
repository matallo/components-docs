Our Design system helps us all speak the same language and contribute to a single source of truth whilst remaining connected to our areas of focus.

### Our design tools

- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) is what we use to design and wireframe
- [Abstract](https://www.goabstract.com/) is where we manage the single source of truth for sketch files and libraries
- [InVision](https://www.invisionapp.com/) is where we put together prototypes
- [Zeplin](https://zeplin.io/) is what we use to detail any additional specifications, assets or codesnippets

### Some key files

- [TransferWise Web Library](https://share.goabstract.com/d7e5640c-6489-4399-9e48-fd836ec9c7a4) (Abstract)
- [Icon Library](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w8fxqupra9ietwf/AADY2otQGgvC-A7zS1dNhk9Ba?dl=0) (Dropbox)
- [Grids](https://www.dropbox.com/s/tfni2e0pyegf1zj/grid.sketch?dl=0) (Dropbox)

### Starting a new project

1. **New project** - Create a new project in Abstract, name it (something that is semantic and easy to reference
1. **Sketch file** - If you’ve already made a sketch file you can import it, if not create one now (best to name it the same as the Abstract project
1. **Branches** - Create a new branch and then start editing in Sketch to open the sketch file
1. **Save and commit** - You can save the file and commit changes when you want to make a commit
1. **Merge to Master** - When your work has been reviewed and finalised you can merge to the master branch to keep the file clean
