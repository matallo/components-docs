# Copy

## Because we all write copy.

<div>
  <p className="lead">Whether that’s in a blog, an email, a script, a Facebook post, a button or a banner.</p>
</div>

The way we sound when we’re writing is a huge part of how people perceive us. So we should take just as much care and pride in how we write as we do in how our UI looks or how our code runs.

Everything we say, though it may be crafted by many, feels like it’s all from one voice.

To help you get your words right, we’ve put all our writing rules and guides in one place. So before you write anything for TransferWise, give it a read.
